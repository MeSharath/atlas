Title: Automated Solo Travel Itinerary Generator

As a solo traveler, I want to automatically generate a travel itinerary so that I can have a personalized and adaptive plan that responds to my preferences and real-time conditions like weather.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The system must generate a multi-day itinerary based on the user's destination, travel dates, and selected interests (e.g., history, food, adventure).
- The itinerary must dynamically update when real-time weather data indicates adverse conditions (e.g., suggest an indoor museum instead of a park during rain).
- The user must be able to modify their preferences during the trip (e.g., change from "adventure" to "relaxation"), and the remaining itinerary must adapt accordingly.
- The itinerary must prioritize and suggest accommodations and activities known to be safe and suitable for solo travelers.
- Each suggested activity in the itinerary must include key details such as address, opening hours, estimated cost, and travel time from the previous location.
- The full itinerary, including the route between locations, must be visually represented on an integrated map.

### Dependencies
- **Google Gemini Pro:** For natural language processing and itinerary generation logic.
- **Vertex AI:** To host and manage the AI models.
- **Google Maps API:** For mapping, place details, and routing.
- **Windsurf (or other weather API):** For real-time weather data.
- **Firebase:** For storing user profiles, preferences, and generated itineraries.
- **BigQuery:** For analyzing user interaction data to improve suggestions.

### Measurement of Success
- The system successfully generates a complete 3-day itinerary for a solo trip to a specified city.
- The itinerary successfully reroutes a user to an indoor activity within 5 minutes of a real-time weather alert for rain.
- A change in user preference from "outdoor" to "art" successfully replaces at least two upcoming outdoor activities with relevant indoor alternatives.
- User satisfaction surveys indicate that 80% of testers feel the generated itineraries are personalized, safe, and genuinely adaptive.
